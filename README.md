# ELECTRONIC-SYSTEMS-LABORATORY

This repository stores my laboratory notes for the Electronic Systems Laboratory course. Its purpose is to make my lab work, guides, and reports available so anyone can review them.

## Repository structure

The repository is organized by practice. Each practice has its own folder named in a consistent way, and inside each practice folder you will typically find:

- `guide.*` — the lab working guide for the practice (could be in PDF, Markdown, or other formats).
- `report.*` — the report I wrote to explain the work I did (usually PDF or Markdown).
- Optional: `prelab.*` — a previous study or preparatory notes made before performing the lab work (theoretical background, calculations, planning, etc.)

## Conventions and tips

- File naming: guides are named with `Pràctica #` and reports with `Informe P#` to make navigation predictable.
- If a practice includes preparatory work, it will often be named `EP#` or `Previ #`.

## Notes and disclaimer

- These notes and reports reflect my personal work and understanding of the lab practices.
- They are shared for reference and educational purposes only. Use at your own discretion.
